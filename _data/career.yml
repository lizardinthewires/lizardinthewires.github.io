      I was fully responsible for all maintenance and development of marketing site, Wordpress blog and marketing emails. I reduced the load time of the marketing site by over 3 seconds and launched a redesigned version of the marketing site and initial version of the marketing blog.

I was also responsible for QA on the marketing site and blog and was able to automate most of that process through Ruby and Selenium.
